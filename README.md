# Employee Tracker

## Description
The Employee Tracker is a content management system (CMS) interface that will allow non-developers to interact and view their staff's information. Using a command-line application, business owners have the ability to manage and assess their departments and employees. Node.js and Inquirer are needed for this system. Additonally, user will need to use the [pg package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
